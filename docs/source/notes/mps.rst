.. _MPS-Backend:

MPS backend
===========

:mod:`mps` device enables high-performance
training on GPU for MacOS devices with Metal programming framework.  It
introduces a new device to map Machine Learning computational graphs and
primitives on highly efficient Metal Performance Shaders Graph framework and
tuned kernels provided by Metal Performance Shaders framework respectively.

The new MPS backend extends the PyTorch ecosystem and provides existing scripts
capabilities to setup and run operations on GPU.
